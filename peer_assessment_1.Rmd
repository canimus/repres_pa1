#### Loading and preprocessing the data
Loading the data from the original location in the Coursera website and assigning it, to the data variable.
```{r cache=TRUE}
temp <- tempfile()

# Remote location of file to be downloaded
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",temp)

# 1.1 Load Data
# Reading the csv data into the data variable
data <- read.csv(unz(temp, "activity.csv"))

# 1.2 Parse data
data_source <- tbl_df(data)
data <- data_source %>% replace(is.na(.), 0)

# Convert date column to date objects
data$date <- ymd(data$date)
unlink(temp)
```

#### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Perform some statistical computations for the steps
```{r}
# Calculate total number of steps per day
print(mean(data$steps, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Using dplyr package to create a filter pipeline that sums all steps grouping by the date column
```{r}
steps_per_day <- data %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(total=sum(steps))
```

### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
kable(steps_per_day)
```


2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
g <- ggplot(steps_per_day, aes(x=total))
g + geom_histogram(color="#333333", fill="#508cdd", bins = 30)
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
mean(steps_per_day$total)
median(steps_per_day$total)
```

### What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
interval_plot <- aggregate(x=list(avg_steps=data$steps), by=list(interval=data$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)

ggplot(data=interval_plot, aes(x=interval, y=avg_steps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("Intervals in 5 Minues") +
    ylab("Mean (in # of Steps)") 
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
max_steps <- max(interval_plot$avg_steps)
interval_plot %>% filter(avg_steps >= max_steps) %>% select(interval)
```

### Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
```{r}
sum(is.na(data_source$steps))
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
avg_steps_agg <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = data_source, FUN = mean)
fill_empty_values <- numeric()
for (i in 1:nrow(data_source)) {
    obs <- data_source[i, ]
    if (is.na(obs$steps)) {
        steps <- subset(avg_steps_agg, interval == obs$interval)$steps
    } else {
        steps <- obs$steps
    }
    fill_empty_values <- c(fill_empty_values, steps)
}
```

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r}
fill_data_source <- data_source
fill_data_source$steps <- fill_empty_values
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
g <- ggplot(fill_data_source, aes(x=steps))
g + geom_histogram(color="#333333", fill="#508cdd", bins = 30)
```

**The distribution appears to be concentrated in the first values**

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}

```
